Care and Feeding of the Weinberg house

Mail: Box 2, number 5 on Hemlock – Please forward (if necessary) to: Leah Weinberg, 300 Stern Rd, Fanny Bay, BC V0R 1W0 – we&#39;ll talk, there may be folks coming over who will pick it up from you.

Garbage: Out on Friday between 5:30 am and 7am. Green can and blue box and bag can go every week – garbage can only goes every other week. We only take the garbage and blue bag/box when they are fill. The green one gets smelly if it sits too long – bear attraction. If you have garden greens to put in it, it does help to keep the smell down, worse case , pour some bleach in it. Just don&#39;t put into the septic system.

Outside: Check pots for wetness, don&#39;t water if damp. The hanging pot outside the kitchen will probably want more frequent watering. Mower and gas in garage, battery trimmer in shed, electric trimmer in garage. Garden tools in shed.

Cleaning: Please, do not use any cleaning products on the floors. I vacuum (not too often) vacuum hose is in the garage (dark hose).

Only mop floors when necessary, with a hot, damp mop – a variety of choices in the laundry room.

Furnace: control in small hall off master bedroom. It is turned off, but if you need air conditioning, you will need to turn it on. For heat, just use room heaters downstairs or the gas fireplaces.

Fire- Extinguisher in kitchen. Forest fire – get the hell out, don&#39;t try to save stuff. If you can&#39;t get a car out, take the bikes

Septic System:As much as possible, only pee, poop, toilet paper and grey water. No tissues, sanitary products, etc.

Our sound system finally declared it&#39;s age and crapped out. I don&#39;t know if you can hook a computer or phone to the speakers – if you can figure it out, go for it.

There is a Farmer&#39;s market on Sundays 9am-1pm at at the Library across from Centennial School. A smaller one in port moody at the rec centre – Wed. 3pm – 7pm

Bedding Spare sheets and duvet&#39;s in the tv room, in the linen closet and in our upstairs bathroom. Single bed mattress and box spring in the furnace room, another in the basement.

Standing lamp in living room is on a timer, it turns itself on and off. Table lamps are joined and can be run from the switches in the small hall next to the furnace switch.

Screens: There are screens for every opening window in the furnace room. I haven&#39;t put them up because we wanted the windows cleaned first. Put up screens as you need them.
